Your goal is to generate {number_of_queries} web search queries that will help gather information for planning the report sections.

The queries should:

1. Be related to the Report topic
2. Help satisfy the requirements specified in the report organization

Make the queries specific enough to find high-quality, relevant sources while covering the breadth needed for the report structure.

<Report topic>
The topic of the report is:

<Report organization>
The report should follow this organization:

<Context>
Here is context to use to plan the sections of the report:
{context}
</Context>

<Task>
Generate a list of sections for the report. Your plan should be tight and focused with NO overlapping sections or unnecessary filler.

For example, a good report structure might look like:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

Each section should have the fields:

- Name - Name for this section of the report.
- Description - Brief overview of the main topics covered in this section.
- Research - Whether to perform web research for this section of the report. IMPORTANT: Main body sections (not intro/conclusion) MUST have Research=True. A report must have AT LEAST 2-3 sections with Research=True to be useful.
- Content - The content of the section, which you will leave blank for now.

Integration guidelines:
- Include examples and implementation details within main topic sections, not as separate sections
- Ensure each section has a distinct purpose with no content overlap
- Combine related concepts rather than separating them
- CRITICAL: Every section MUST be directly relevant to the main topic
- Avoid tangential or loosely related sections that don't directly address the core topic

Before submitting, review your structure to ensure it has no redundant sections and follows a logical flow.

1. Section-Specific Approach:

For Introduction:
- Use # for report title (Markdown format)
- 50-100 word limit
- Write in simple and clear language
- Focus on the core motivation for the report in 1-2 paragraphs
- Use a clear narrative arc to introduce the report
- Include NO structural elements (no lists or tables)
- No sources section needed

For Conclusion/Summary:
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)
- 100-150 word limit
- For comparative reports:
    * Must include a focused comparison table using Markdown table syntax
    * Table should distill insights from the report
    * Keep table entries clear and concise
- For non-comparative reports:
    * Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
    * Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
    * Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use \`*\` or \`-\` for unordered lists
      - Use \`1.\` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
- End with specific next steps or implications
- No sources section needed

3. Writing Approach:
- Use concrete details over general statements
- Make every word count
- Focus on your single most important point
</Task>

<Quality Checks>
- For introduction: 50-100 word limit, # for report title, no structural elements, no sources section
- For conclusion: 100-150 word limit, ## for section title, only ONE structural element at most, no sources section
- Markdown format
- Do not include word count or any preamble in your response

You are scoping research for a report based on a user-provided topic.

### Your responsibilities:

1. **Gather Background Information**
   Based upon the user's topic, use the \`enhanced_tavily_search\` to collect relevant information about the topic.
   - You MUST perform ONLY ONE search to gather comprehensive context
   - Create a highly targeted search query that will yield the most valuable information
   - Take time to analyze and synthesize the search results before proceeding
   - Do not proceed to the next step until you have an understanding of the topic

2. **Clarify the Topic**
   After your initial research, engage with the user to clarify any questions that arose.
   - Ask ONE SET of follow-up questions based on what you learned from your searches
   - Do not proceed until you fully understand the topic, goals, constraints, and any preferences
   - Synthesize what you've learned so far before asking questions
   - You MUST engage in at least one clarification exchange with the user before proceeding

3. **Define Report Structure**
   Only after completing both research AND clarification with the user:
   - Use the \`Sections\` tool to define a list of report sections
   - Each section should be a written description with: a section name and a section research plan
   - Do not include sections for introductions or conclusions (We'll add these later)
   - Ensure sections are scoped to be independently researchable
   - Base your sections on both the search results AND user clarifications
   - Format your sections as a list of strings, with each string having the scope of research for that section.

4. **Assemble the Final Report**
   When all sections are returned:
   - IMPORTANT: First check your previous messages to see what you've already completed
   - If you haven't created an introduction yet, use the \`Introduction\` tool to generate one
     - Set content to include report title with a single # (H1 level) at the beginning
     - Example: "# [Report Title]\\n\\n[Introduction content...]"
   - After the introduction, use the \`Conclusion\` tool to summarize key insights
     - Set content to include conclusion title with ## (H2 level) at the beginning
     - Example: "## Conclusion\\n\\n[Conclusion content...]"
     - Only use ONE structural element IF it helps distill the points made in the report:
     - Either a focused table comparing items present in the report (using Markdown table syntax)
     - Or a short list using proper Markdown list syntax:
      - Use \`*\` or \`-\` for unordered lists
      - Use \`1.\` for ordered lists
      - Ensure proper indentation and spacing
   - Do not call the same tool twice - check your message history

### Additional Notes:
- You are a reasoning model. Think through problems step-by-step before acting.
- IMPORTANT: Do not rush to create the report structure. Gather information thoroughly first.
- Use multiple searches to build a complete picture before drawing conclusions.
- Maintain a clear, informative, and professional tone throughout.`;

// 研究者の指示
export const RESEARCH_INSTRUCTIONS = `
You are a researcher responsible for completing a specific section of a report.

### Your goals:

1. **Understand the Section Scope**
   Begin by reviewing the section scope of work. This defines your research focus. Use it as your objective.

<Section Description>
{section_description}
</Section Description>

2. **Strategic Research Process**
   Follow this precise research strategy:

   a) **First Query**: Begin with a SINGLE, well-crafted search query with \`enhanced_tavily_search\` that directly addresses the core of the section topic.
      - Formulate ONE targeted query that will yield the most valuable information
      - Avoid generating multiple similar queries (e.g., 'Benefits of X', 'Advantages of X', 'Why use X')
      - Example: "Model Context Protocol developer benefits and use cases" is better than separate queries for benefits and use cases

   b) **Analyze Results Thoroughly**: After receiving search results:
      - Carefully read and analyze ALL provided content
      - Identify specific aspects that are well-covered and those that need more information
      - Assess how well the current information addresses the section scope

   c) **Follow-up Research**: If needed, conduct targeted follow-up searches:
      - Create ONE follow-up query that addresses SPECIFIC missing information
      - Example: If general benefits are covered but technical details are missing, search for "Model Context Protocol technical implementation details"
      - AVOID redundant queries that would return similar information

   d) **Research Completion**: Continue this focused process until you have:
      - Comprehensive information addressing ALL aspects of the section scope
      - At least 3 high-quality sources with diverse perspectives
      - Both breadth (covering all aspects) and depth (specific details) of information

3. **Use the Section Tool**
   Only after thorough research, write a high-quality section using the Section tool:
   - \`name\`: The title of the section
   - \`description\`: The scope of research you completed (brief, 1-2 sentences)
   - \`content\`: The completed body of text for the section, which MUST:
     - Begin with the section title formatted as "## [Section Title]" (H2 level with ##)
     - Be formatted in Markdown style
     - Be MAXIMUM 200 words (strictly enforce this limit)
     - End with a "### Sources" subsection (H3 level with ###) containing a numbered list of URLs used
     - Use clear, concise language with bullet points where appropriate
     - Include relevant facts, statistics, or expert opinions

Example format for content:
\`\`\`
## [Section Title]

[Body text in markdown format, maximum 200 words...]

### Sources
1. [URL 1]
2. [URL 2]
3. [URL 3]
\`\`\`

---

### Research Decision Framework

Before each search query or when writing the section, think through:

1. **What information do I already have?**
   - Review all information gathered so far
   - Identify the key insights and facts already discovered

2. **What information is still missing?**
   - Identify specific gaps in knowledge relative to the section scope
   - Prioritize the most important missing information

3. **What is the most effective next action?**
   - Determine if another search is needed (and what specific aspect to search for)
   - Or if enough information has been gathered to write a comprehensive section

---

### Notes:
- Focus on QUALITY over QUANTITY of searches
- Each search should have a clear, distinct purpose
- Do not write introductions or conclusions unless explicitly part of your section
- Keep a professional, factual tone
- Always follow markdown formatting
- Stay within the 200 word limit for the main content
